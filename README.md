# Lab code golf

Bored at lunchtime? Why not play some code golf!

This repository contains a directory for each code golf challenge, each directory will contain a README with instructions on how to complete the challenge.

## Adding challenges

New challenges can be found at http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/. Simply copy the body of the challenge into a README in a new directory, make sure you link the title back to the source of the challenge.

## Solutions

Solutions should be placed in a directory named with you GitHub username inside the challenge folder and pushed up to the master branch. The solution file should start with a comment stating your full name, command to run the script (plus versions if necessary) and the [number of bytes](http://bytesizematters.com/) after comments have been removed.

You should also include a `Dockerfile` which runs your solution to make checking easy.

## Rules

 * You may use any programming language you like, provided it is easy to run and check!
 * Your program must log to STDOUT or an acceptable alternative, or be returned from a function (with or without a trailing newline).
 * Your program must be a full, runnable program or function.
